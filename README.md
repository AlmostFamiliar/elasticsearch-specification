# barebones example

This references `specification` locally so you need to cd in to that directory and install its modules once

```bash
$ npm install
```
then build
```bash
$ npm start
```

then from the `barebones-example` you can try the `specification` module locally using

```bash
$ npm install
$ nodejs index
```
